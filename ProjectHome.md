This project aims to offer tools to integrate with Django, and possibly
Python at large, databases made with [CMDBuild](http://www.cmdbuild.org).

Currently, you can use the introspection tool to create a working Django model for
a CMDBuild database.

Look at the [README file](http://dj-cmdbuild.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.txt) for up-to-date information.
